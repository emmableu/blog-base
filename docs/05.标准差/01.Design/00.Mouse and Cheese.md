Define an AI algorithm for a game where two mice on a board  can move up, down, left, right to look for a piece of cheese provided the manhattan distance to the cheese on any given turn. Additionally, assume there are cats, dogs, etc. also on the board that chase in the natural order, and their positions are known on any turn.
