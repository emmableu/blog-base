## Description

In the prediction game, the first player gives the second player some stock market data for some consecutive days. The data contains a company's stock price on each day. The rules for the game are:
- Player 1 will tell player 2 a day number
- Player 2 has to find the nearest day on which stock price is smaller than the given day
- If there are two results, then player 2 finds the day number which is smaller
- If no such day exits, then the answer is -1.

### Example 1
```
stock_data size n =10;
stock_data = [5,6,8,4,9,10,8,3,6,4]
queries = [6,5,4]
Result is [5,4,8]
```
explanation: 

On day 6, the stock price is 10. Both 9 and 8 are lower prices one day away. Choose 9 (day 5) because it is before day 6. 

On day 5, the stock price is 9. 4 is the closest lower price on day 4. 

On day 4, the stock price is 4. The only lower price is on day 8. The return array is [5,4,8]

 

### Example 2
```
stock_data size n = 10
stock_data = [5,6,8,4,9,10,8,3,6,4]
queries = [3,1,8]
Result is [2,4,-1]
```
explanation: 

 If the day number is 3.both days 2 and 4 are smaller.choose the earlier day,day 2.

 If the day number is 1,day 4 is the closet day with a smaller price.

 If the day number is 8,there is no day where the price is less than 3.

 The return array is `[2,4,-1]`

 
## Requirement


     Complete the 'predict_answer' function below.

     The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.

     The function accepts following parameters:

     1. INTEGER_ARRAY stock_data

     2. INTEGER_ARRAY queries

## Solution
根据题意，联想到numpy的argsort，
argsort([3,1,2]) = [1, 2, 0]

```python
import unittest

def predict_answer(stock_data, queries):


class PredictAnswerTest(unittest.TestCase)
def test_answer(self):
    self.assertListEquals(predict_answer([5,6,8,4,9,10,8,3,6,4], [6,5,4]), [5,4,8])
    self.assertListEquals(predict_answer([5,6,8,4,9,10,8,3,6,4], [3,1,8]), [2,4,-1])
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
