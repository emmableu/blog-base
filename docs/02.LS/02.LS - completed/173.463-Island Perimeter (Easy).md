## Description:
You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.


## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.

Example 2:
Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: grid = [[1,0]]
Output: 4
```
## 岛屿问题dfs模版:
参考（https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-islands/solution/dao-yu-lei-wen-ti-de-tong-yong-jie-fa-dfs-bian-li-/）
```python
class Solution:
    def func(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # 题目要求的function
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == "1":
                    # 题目要求的东西
                    self.dfs(grid, r, c)
        return #题目要求的function
        
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        # base case：如果坐标超出网格，直接返回
        if not self.in_area(grid, r, c):
            return
        if grid[r][c] != "1":
            return 
        grid[r][c] = "2" #标记以防止重复visit
        self.dfs(grid, r-1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r+1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c-1)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c+1)
        
    def in_area(self, grid, r, c):
        return r >= 0 and r < len(grid) and c >= 0 and c < len(grid[0])
```
## Solution: DFS
重点：在 dfs中 `in_area` 或者 `grid[r][c]==0` 都说明到了边界，所以都return 1

最后return `lt + rt + up + lo`
```python
class Solution:
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    p = self.dfs(grid, r, c)
                    return p
                                
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        if not self.in_area(grid, r, c):
            return 1
        if grid[r][c] == 0:
            return 1
        if grid[r][c] == 2:
            return 0
            
        grid[r][c] = 2
        
        lt = self.dfs(grid, r-1, c)
        rt = self.dfs(grid, r+1, c)
        up = self.dfs(grid, r, c-1)
        lo = self.dfs(grid, r, c+1)
        return lt + rt + up + lo
        
    def in_area(self, grid, r, c):
        return r >= 0 and r < len(grid) and c >=0 and c < len(grid[0])        
```
