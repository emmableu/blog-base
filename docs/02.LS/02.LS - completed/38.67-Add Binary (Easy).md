## Description:

Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
``` 

Constraints:

- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
- a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.


## Method
directly adding one character at a time.
```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, num1, num2):
        i1, i2 = len(num1)-1, len(num2)-1
        carry = 0
        res = []
        while i1 >= 0 or i2 >= 0 or carry > 0:
            a = int(num1[i1]) if i1 >= 0 else 0
            b = int(num2[i2]) if i2 >= 0 else 0
            s = a + b + carry 
            cur, carry = s%2, s//2
            res.append(cur)
            i1 -= 1
            i2 -= 1
        return "".join([str(ele) for ele in res[::-1]]) 
```
