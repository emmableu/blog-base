## solution: DFS
(dx, dy) is direction, for example `(0, 1)` is up, and by using `dx, dy = -dy, dx`, (0,1) becomes (-1, 0), which is a left vector in x-y axis plane.

```python
class Solution:
    def cleanRoom(self, robot):
        vis = set()
        def dfs(x, y, dx, dy):
            # 1, Clean current
            robot.clean()
            vis.add((x, y))

            # 2, Clean next
            for _ in range(4):
                if (x + dx, y + dy) not in vis and robot.move():
                    dfs(x + dx, y + dy, dx, dy)
                robot.turnLeft()
                dx, dy = -dy, dx

            # 3, Back to previous position and direction
            robot.turnLeft(); robot.turnLeft()
            robot.move()
            robot.turnLeft(); robot.turnLeft()

        dfs(0, 0, 0, 1)
