## solution
use `idx` to indicate the next position to write. The next position to write is also the current length.  
with every read4, decrease `n`, and update `buf` and `idx`. when n == 0, return `idx`
```python
"""
The read4 API is already defined for you.

    @param buf4, a list of characters
    @return an integer
    def read4(buf4):

# Below is an example of how the read4 API can be called.
file = File("abcdefghijk") # File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
buf4 = [' '] * 4 # Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['a','b','c','d'], fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['e','f','g','h'], fp points to 'i'
read4(buf4) # read4 returns 3. Now buf = ['i','j','k',...], fp points to end of file
"""

def read(self, buf, n):
    idx = 0
    while n > 0:
        # read file to buf4
        buf4 = [""]*4
        l = read4(buf4)
        # if no more char in file, return
        if not l:
            return idx
        # write buf4 into buf directly
        for i in range(min(l, n)):
            buf[idx] = buf4[i]
            idx += 1
            n -= 1
    return idx
```
