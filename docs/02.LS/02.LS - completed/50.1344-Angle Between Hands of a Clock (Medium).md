## Description
Given two numbers, hour and minutes. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165

Example 2:
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 30
Output: 75

Example 3:
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5

Example 4:
Input: hour = 4, minutes = 50
Output: 155

Example 5:
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 0
Output: 0
```
## Solution
把 hour 和 minute都转化成以 12 为一圈算，然后计算两个的 abs(差值)再乘30  
返回 min(diff, 360 - diff)  
注意：小时的时针不是固定在某个点，而是根据分钟的时间会变化。
```python
class Solution:
    def angleClock(self, hour, minutes):
        hour = hour + minutes/60
        minutes = minutes/5
        diff = abs(minutes - hour) * 30
        return min(diff, 360 - diff)
```
