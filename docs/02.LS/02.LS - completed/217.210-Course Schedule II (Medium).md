## Description
[LC link](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/)
  [explanation](http://zxi.mytechroad.com/blog/graph/leetcode-210-course-schedule-ii/)
There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses. If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].

Example 3:
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```
## Solution
- 传统dfs只有一个visited状态
- 拓扑dfs有两个状态： `visited` and `visiting`
- 碰到visited：ok； 碰到  `visiting`: 说明有环，返回false。
将后序遍历的结果进行反转，就是拓扑排序的结果。
```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        course_dict = defaultdict(list)
        for p in prerequisites:
            course_dict[p[0]].append(p[1])
        vis = [0]*numCourses
        res = []
        def dfs(res, vis, i):
            if vis[i] == 2: #visited
                return True
            if vis[i] == 1: #visiting
                return False
            vis[i] = 1
            for child in course_dict[i]:
                is_valid = dfs(res, vis, child)
                if not is_valid:
                    return False
            vis[i] = 2
            res.append(i)
            return True

        for ele in range(numCourses):
            if vis[ele] == 0:
                is_valid = dfs(res, vis, ele)
                if not is_valid:
                    return []
        return res
```
