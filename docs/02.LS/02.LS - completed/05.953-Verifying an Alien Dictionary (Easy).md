## Description:
In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.


## Examples
```
Example 1:

Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

Example 3:
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) 
According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', 
where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```
Constraints:

- 1 <= words.length <= 100
- 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
- order.length == 26
- All characters in words[i] and order are English lowercase letters.

## Method
- 把这个order变成一个dictionary `{"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2 ,...}` (`d = {i:o for o, i in enumerate(order)}`)
- 把word变成的每一个变成根据dictionary得到的数字list: 如果 d 是 `{"a": 0, "b": 1, "c": 2 ,...}`, abc这个word 就转化成 [0,1,2]

## API
```python
a = [0,1,2]
print(list(zip(a, a[1:])))
```
the above prints: `[(0, 1), (1, 2)]`

## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isAlienSorted(self, words: List[str], order: str) -> bool:
        d = {i:o for o, i in enumerate(order)} 
        words = [[d[c] for c in word] for word in words]
        for a, b in zip(words, words[1:]):
            if a > b:
                return False
        return True
```
