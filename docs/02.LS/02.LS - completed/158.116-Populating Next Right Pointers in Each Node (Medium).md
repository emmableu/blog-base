## Description
You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

## Examples
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.


input:[]
output: []
```

## Solution:
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        self.next = next
"""

class Solution:
    # 主函数
    def connect(self, root):
        if not root:
            return None
        self.connect_two(root.left, root.right)
        return root
        # 辅助函数

    def connect_two(self, a, b):
        if not a or not b:
            return

        # 前序遍历位置
        # 连接传入的两个节点：
        a.next = b
        # 连接相同父节点的两个子节点：
        self.connect_two(a.left, a.right)
        self.connect_two(b.left, b.right)
        # 连接跨越父节点的两个子节点：
        self.connect_two(a.right, b.left)
```
