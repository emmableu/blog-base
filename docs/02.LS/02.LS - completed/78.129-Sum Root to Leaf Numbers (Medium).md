## Description
You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from 0 to 9 only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path 1 -> 2 -> 3 represents the number 123.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a 32-bit integer.

A leaf node is a node with no children.

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.

Example 2:
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

## Solution
`path_sum`: 当前path的值
`res`: 累计的总和
```python
class Solution(object):
    def sumNumbers(self, root): # DFS recursively 
        res = 0
        def dfs(root, path_sum):
            nonlocal res
            if not root:
                return
            if not root.left and not root.right:
                path_sum = path_sum*10 + root.val
                res += path_sum
            dfs(root.left, path_sum*10+root.val)
            dfs(root.right, path_sum*10+root.val)
        dfs(root, 0)
        return res
```
