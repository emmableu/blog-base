## Description
A transformation sequence from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every `s_i` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
`sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

## Examples
```
Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.
Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```
Constraints:

- 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10
- endWord.length == beginWord.length
- 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000
- wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
- beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
- beginWord != endWord
- All the words in wordList are unique.

## Solution: 双向bfs
[双向bfs模版](https://emmableu.github.io/leetcode-note-site/pages/8b354b/)
要从26个字母走word，而不是从wordlist里面一个个检查下一个word。
- 原因是假设wordlist是很长的，检查wordlist是O(n).从26个字母走word是O(1)
```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, begin, end, word_list):
        word_set = set(word_list)
        q1 = {begin}
        q2 = {end}
        if end not in word_set:
            return 0
        vis = q1 | q2
        step = 0
        while q1 and q2:
            if len(q1) > len(q2):
                q1, q2 = q2, q1
            temp = set()
            step += 1
            for cur in q1:
                for new in self.generate_new(cur):
                    if new == cur:
                        continue
                    if new not in word_set:
                        continue
                    if new in q2:
                        # return step 要 + 1，因为计算的不是path的长度
                        # 而是path上word有几个（带首位），
                        # 所以是path的长度再+1
                        return step + 1
                    if new not in vis:
                        temp.add(new)
                        vis.add(new)
            q1 = temp
        return 0


    def generate_new(self, word):
        for i in range(len(word)):
            for char in "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz":
                new = list(word)
                new[i] = char
                yield "".join(new)
```
