## Description
You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.

Example 2:
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"

Example 3:
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```


## Solution： 栈
- stk: 栈内元素为[value, number_of_occurance]，到该pop的时候就pop
- 怎么判断是否该pop？当 当前值为栈的最后一个时，如果`number_of_occurance <= k-2` 则 `number_of_occurance += 1`, 否则则pop
- 注意： `stk`需要预处理之后才能return (e.g., `stk = [["a" 2]]) => "aa"`)
```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        stk = []
        for char in s:
            if stk and char == stk[-1][0]:
                if stk[-1][1] == k-1:
                    stk.pop()
                else:
                    stk[-1][1] += 1
            else:
                stk.append([char, 1])
        res = []
        for char, cnt in stk:
            res.extend([char] * cnt)
        return "".join(res)
```

## API knowledge:
```python
for x, y in [[1,2], [3,4]]:
    print(x, y)
```
the above is able to print 1,2, (newline) 3,4.
