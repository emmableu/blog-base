Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

Example 2:
Input: root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
Output: 2
``` 

## Solution: BFS
```python
class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        maxsum, level, maxLevel = -float('inf'), 0, 0
        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(root)
        while q:
            level += 1
            cursum = 0
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                cursum += node.val
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            if maxsum < cursum:
                maxsum, maxLevel = cursum, level        
        return maxLevel
```
