## Description
You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an integer array days. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for costs[0] dollars,
- a 7-day pass is sold for costs[1] dollars, and
- a 30-day pass is sold for costs[2] dollars.
The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of days.

 
## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total, you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.

Example 2:
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total, you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.

## Solution
- dp[i] 到当前这一天所需要花费的最小费用
```
input： days = [1,4,6,7,8,20]， costs: [2, 7, 15]
dp:[0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 11]
```
```python
class Solution:
    def mincostTickets(self, days, costs):
        dp = [0] * (days[-1] + 1) # dp数组，每个元素代表到当前天数最少钱数，为下标方便对应，多加一个 0 位置
        days_idx = 0 #当天对应的是days idx的哪一个
        for i in range(1, len(dp)):

            # 如果当天不需要旅行，那么到达这一天所需要花费的最小费用 
            # = 前一天所需要的最小费用
            if i != days[days_idx]:
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] 
            
            # 如果当天需要旅行 (当天的天数在days中) 
            else:
                dp[i] = min(dp[max(0, i - 1)] + costs[0],
                        dp[max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1],
                        dp[max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2])
                days_idx += 1
            
        return dp[-1]
