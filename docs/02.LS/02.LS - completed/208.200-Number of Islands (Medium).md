## Description:
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

## Examples
```
Example 1:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

```python
class Solution:
    def func(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # 题目要求的function
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == "1":
                    # 题目要求的东西
                    self.dfs(grid, r, c)
        return #题目要求的function
        
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        # base case：如果坐标超出网格，直接返回
        if not self.in_area(grid, r, c):

        self.dfs(grid, r-1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r+1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c-1)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c+1)
        
    def in_area(self, grid, r, c):
        return r >= 0 and r < len(grid) and c >= 0 and c < len(grid[0])
```
## Methods
- DFS

## Implementations
### DFS
```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        num = 0
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == "1":
                    num += 1
                    self.dfs(grid, r, c)
        return num
        
        
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        if not self.in_area(grid, r, c):
            return
        if grid[r][c] != "1":
            return 
        grid[r][c] = "2"
        self.dfs(grid, r-1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r+1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c-1)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c+1)
        
    
    def in_area(self, grid, r, c):
        return r >= 0 and r < len(grid) and c >= 0 and c < len(grid[0])
