## Description:
There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

 
## Examples
```
Example 1:

Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
Example 2:

Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
Example 3:

Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
Example 4:

Input: heights = [2,2,2,2]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Buildings cannot see the ocean if there are buildings of the same height to its right.
```
## Method:
- 对于比如`[4,2,3,1]`这个数组，先在res里面放`[3]`, 3是index，代表数字1
- 然后从右往左，比res的当前倒数第一个大就放进去，所以放成 `[3,2,0]` 表示 `[1,3,4]`
- reverse, 变成 `[0, 2, 3]`表示 `[4,3,1]`
## My solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights):
        res = [len(heights)-1]
        for i in range(len(heights)-2, -1, -1):
            if heights[i] > heights[res[-1]]:
                res.append(i)
        return res[::-1]
```
