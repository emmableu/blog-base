Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```
Example 2:
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```
Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        dic = Counter(s)
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if dic[c] == 1:
                return i
        return -1
```
