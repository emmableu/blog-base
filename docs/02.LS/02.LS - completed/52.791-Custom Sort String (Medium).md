## Description
You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the words of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.


## Example
```
Example 1:
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
解释: 
order中出现了字符 "a", "b", "c", 所以 "a", "b", "c" 的顺序应该是 "c", "b", "a". 
由于 "d" 没有在order中出现, 它可以放在order的任意位置. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" 都是合法的输出。

Example 2:
Input: order = "cbafg", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
```
## APIs
The `pop()` method removes and returns an element from a dictionary having the given key.
```python
# create a dictionary
marks = { 'Physics': 67, 'Chemistry': 72, 'Math': 89 }
element = marks.pop('Chemistry')
print('Popped Marks:', element)
# Output: Popped Marks: 72
```
## Solution (O (len(order) + len(s)))
- `cnt`: a Counter dict. `s = "aab" => cnt = {a:2, b:1}`
- `res`: 先走一遍order，把里面的东西按顺序放进res（如果存在在cnt里的话）,然后再放cnt里面剩下的
```python
from collections import Counter
class Solution:
    def customSortString(self, order, s):
        cnt = Counter(s)
        res = []
        for c in order:
            if c in cnt:
                res.extend([c] * cnt.pop(c))
        for k, v in cnt.items():
            res.extend([k] * v)
        return "".join(res)
```
