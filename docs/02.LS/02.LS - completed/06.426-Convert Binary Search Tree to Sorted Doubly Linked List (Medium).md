## Description:
Convert a Binary Search Tree to a sorted Circular Doubly-Linked List in place.

You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.

We want to do the transformation *in place*. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3]
4
    - 2
        - 1
        - 3
    - 5
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: The figure below shows the transformed BST. The solid line indicates the successor relationship, while the dashed line means the predecessor relationship.

Example 2:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3]

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []
Explanation: Input is an empty tree. Output is also an empty Linked List.

Example 4:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```
## solution
其实就是左右节点指向改变，右节点指向下一个比它大的数，左节点指向比它小的数。

又是二叉搜索树，自然想到中序遍历。
- `dummy`: doubly linked list的假头，最后返回 dummy.right
```
dummy -> head <->tail
```
- `lst_node`: 在每次pop出来后的`node`就变成`lst_node`
- `stk`, `node`: 中序遍历常规变量
```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
"""
class Solution:
    def treeToDoublyList(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 
        dummy = Node(-1)
        # 最后返回的是dummy.right
        lst_node = dummy
        stk, node = [], root
        
        while stk or node:
            while node:
                stk.append(node)
                node = node.left
            node = stk.pop()
            # 把 (tree) node转化成 lst_node
            lst_node.right = node
            node.left = lst_node
            # lst_node 和node都走到下一个
            lst_node = node
            node = node.right
        
        # 首尾相连
        dummy.right.left = lst_node
        lst_node.right = dummy.right
        return dummy.right 
```
