## Description
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses? 

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.

Example 2:
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```
## Solution
判断有向图中是否有环。
- 传统dfs只有一个visited状态
- 拓扑dfs有两个状态： `visited` and `visiting`
- 碰到visited：ok； 碰到  `visiting`: 说明有环，返回false。
将后序遍历的结果进行反转，就是拓扑排序的结果。
```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        def dfs(i):
            if visited[i] == 2:  # means visited
                return True
            if visited[i] == 1:  # means visiting
                return False
            visited[i] = 1  # means visiting
            children = course_dict.get(i, [])
            if not children:
                visited[i] = 2
                return True
            for child in children:
                if not dfs(child):
                    return False
            visited[i] = 2
            return True

        visited = [0] * numCourses
        course_dict = defaultdict(list)
        for x, y in prerequisites:
            course_dict[x].append(y)
        for i in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(i):
                return False
        return True
```
