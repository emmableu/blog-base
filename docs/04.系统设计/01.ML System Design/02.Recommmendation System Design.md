## Problem Statement:
 display media (movie/show) recommendations for a Netflix user. Your task is to make recommendations in such a manner that the chance of the user watching them is maximized.

### Explicit v.s. Implicit Feedback
Generally, there are two types of feedback coming from an end-user for a given recommendation.

Explicit feedback faces the missing not at random (MNAR) problem. Users will generally rate those media recommendations that they liked. This means 4/5, 5/5 star ranking are more common than 1/5, 2/5 or 3/5. 

## Architectural Components
we split the recommendation task into two stages.
- Stage 1: Candidate generation
- Stage 2: Ranking of generated candidates

## Metrics

### Online v.s. Offline metrics
Online metrics are used to see the system’s performance through online evaluations on live data during an A/B test.

Offline metrics are used in offline evaluations, which simulate the model’s performance in the production environment.

We might train multiple models and tune and test them offline with the held-out test data (historical interaction of users with recommended media). If its performance gain is worth the engineering effort to bring it into a production environment, the best performing model will then be selected for an online A/B test on live data.

### online metrics:
1. engagement rate: (# sessions with clicks)/(total # sessions) (点进去的video数量/总共的video数量). However, the user might click on a recommended movie but does not find it interesting enough to complete watching it.
2. videos watched: # videos that the user has spent at least a significant time watching (e.g., more than two minutes).  
However, this metric can be problematic when it comes to the user starting to watch movie/series recommendations but not finding them interesting enough to finish them.
3. **session watch time**: Session watch time measures the overall time a user spends watching content based on recommendations in a session. This is the best comparing to 1 and 2, because user may watch one video for 90 minutes in one session among all the videos.

### offline metrics:
#### Mean Average Precision(mAP @ N).
Assume the following:
- The system recommended N = 5 movies.
- The user watched three movies from this recommendation list and ignored the other two.
- Among all the possible movies that the system could have recommended (available on the Netflix platform), only m = 10 are actually relevant to the user (historical data).

Lastly, the “mean” in mAP means that we will calculate the AP with respect to each user’s ratings and take their mean. So, mAP computes the metric for a large set of users to see how the system performs overall on a large set.
