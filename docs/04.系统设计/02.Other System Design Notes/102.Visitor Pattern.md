Basically, you want to implement a mechanism for [double dispatch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_dispatch). Each node in your AST would need to implement an `accept()` method (NOT a `visit()` method). The method takes, as an argument, a visitor object. In the implementation of this `accept()` method, you call a `visit()` method of the visitor object (there will be one for each AST node type; in Java, you'll use parameter overloading, in Python I suppose you can use different `visit_*()` methods). The correct visitor will then be dispatched with the correct Node type as argument.
