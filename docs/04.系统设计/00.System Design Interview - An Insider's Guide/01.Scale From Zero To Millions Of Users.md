## SQL v.s. NoSQL:
[best summary](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sql-vs-nosql)
### SQL：definition, pros, cons
A SQL database supports structured query language (SQL) — a domain-specific programming language for querying and manipulating data in a relational database. The key to the relational model is abstracting data as a set of [tuples](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/streams/4.1.0?topic=types-tuples) organized into “relations,” which allows for abstraction over the physical representation of data and access paths.
#### SQL pros:
- **Flexible queries**: Enables support for diverse workloads. Abstracts data over underlying implementations and allows engines to optimize queries to fit on-disk representations.
- **Reduced data storage footprint**: Due to normalization and other optimization opportunities, a reduced footprint maximizes database performance and resource usage.
- **Strong and well-understood data integrity semantics**: Atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability, or [ACID](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/4.2?topic=processing-acid-properties-transactions), are database properties that guarantee valid transactions.
#### SQL Cons
- **Rigid data models**: Requires careful up-front design to ensure adequate performance and resistance to evolution. SQL has a predefined schema, so changing it often includes downtime.
- **Limited horizontal scalability**: It is either completely unsupported, supported in an ad-hoc way or only supported on relatively immature technologies.
- **Single point of failure**: Non-distributed engines are mitigated by replication and failover techniques.

### NoSQL: definition, pros, cons

#### NoSQL pros
- **Flexible data models**  
NoSQL databases typically have very flexible schemas. A flexible schema allows you to easily make changes to your database as requirements change. You can iterate quickly and continuously integrate new application features to provide value to your users faster.
- **Horizontal scaling**    
Most SQL databases require you to scale-up vertically (migrate to a larger, more expensive server) when you exceed the capacity requirements of your current server. Conversely, most NoSQL databases allow you to scale-out horizontally, meaning you can add cheaper, commodity servers whenever you need to.
- **Fast queries**   
Queries in NoSQL databases can be faster than SQL databases. Why? Data in SQL databases is typically normalized, so queries for a single object or entity require you to join data from multiple tables. As your tables grow in size, the joins can become expensive. However, data in NoSQL databases is typically stored in a way that is optimized for queries. The rule of thumb when you use MongoDB is - **Data is that is accessed together should be stored together**. Queries typically do not require joins, so the queries are very fast.
#### NoSQL cons
they don’t support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) transactions across multiple documents.

## Vertical Scaling v.s. Horizontal Scaling:
- **Vertical Scaling**: scale up, add more power (e.g., CPU, RAM) to your servers
  - has hard limit: it is impossible to add unlimited CPU and manory to a single server.
  - does not have failover and redundancy. If one server goes down, the website/app goes down with it completely. 
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale out, add more servers. more desireble for large-scale applications.

如果只有一个server： if many users access the web server simultaneously and it reaches the web server's load limit, users will experience slower response or fail to connect to the server. To address this, we need load balancing.

## Load balancer:

## Database replication

## Cache:
A cache is a temporay storage area that stores the result of expensive responses or frequently accessed data in memory, so that subsequent requests are served more quickly.    
For example, everytime a new web page loads, one or more database calls are executed to fetch data. The application performance is greatly affected by calling the database repeatedly.  
The cache can mitigate this problem. 

### Cache tier:
The cache tier is a temporary data store layer, much faster than the database.   
benefits:
- better system performance
- reduce database workloads
- ability to scale the cache tier independently

**Read-Through Cache**:
steps:  
- 1. server receive request
- 2. server check if the cache has available response:
    - if yes, send data back to client
    - if not, query the database, store the response in cache, and send it back to the client. 

**Considerations for using cache**:
- **Use cache when data is read frequently but modified infrequently**: since cached data is stored in volatile memory, a cache server is not ideal for persisting data. e.g., if a cache server restarts, all the data in memory is lost. 
- **Implement Expiration policy**: once cached data is expired, it is removed from the cache. 
- **Consitency: Keep the data store (e.g., database) and the cache in sync.** Inconsistency can happen because data-modifying operations on the data store and cache not in a single transaction. 
- **Mitigating failures**: A single cache server may be a **single point of failure**(SPOF) -- **A single point of failure is a part of system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working.**   
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmableu/image/master/scale-from-zero-to-millions-of-users-8.png)
    - So, we may need multiple servers across different data centers to avoid SPOF.
    - Another approach is to overprovision the required memory by certain percentages, this provides a buffer as the memory usage increases. 
- Eviction Policy: Once the cache is full, any requests to add items to the cache might cause existing items to be removed. This is called **cache eviction**. Popular policies:
    - LRU(least-recently-used) (most popular)
    - LFU(Least-frequently-used)
    - FIFO(First-In-First-Out)

## Content Delivery Network (CDN)
A CDN is a network of geographically dispersed servers used to deliver static content. CDN servers cache static contents like images, videos, CSS, JavaScript files, etc.    
When a user vesits a website, a CDN server closest to the user will deliver static content. The further users are from CDN servers, then slower the website loads. 


## Latency v.s. Throughput and their interrelations
latency: elapsed time 从家到学校要走3分钟
throughput: events per unit time. 
bandwidth: 从家到学校的路可以同时走5个人。

higher bandwith => higher throughput, but don't change latency. 




## Thread v.s. Process and how they communicate


## Back-of-the-Envelop Estimation
Latency numbers every programmer should know:
