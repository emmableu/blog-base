### 人物
- 我的任务: 写code，做实验

## Challenge

- Tom is pretty new to this area, 不会写论文
- we started paper writing a month before paper due
	- but every day he kept telling me he has just started. 
	- I proposed to help, and found that he didn't write anything other than section headers. 

## Action
- get something to work with
	- host a recorded zoom meeting, asked him to explain the paper to the labmates, I also helped explaining
	- a whiteboard
	- he is outgoing, so was very expressive / communicative , and the zoom meeting hosted very well, 
	- I asked him to download zoom's auto-transcriptions and the whiteboard, 
		- for the auto-transcriptions, put them into sections
	- do a polish up of the wordings
	- within less than 2 days' time we have the skeleton of the paper
- polish things up
	- i did a thorough read-through
		- put comments: e.g., explain why; summarize, redundant, or missing details; re-write this paragraph, restructure, etc
	- he addressed half of them, 
		- i addressed a couple myself as an example, 
		- then he addressed the rest
	- we did this in another 3 rounds. paper good enough. 
- we gave it to our advisor 1 week prior to due
	- my advisor did similar. 

## Results
- 直接结果： 项目/论文
- collaborator feedback/future step
	- Tom enjoyed the paper-writing process a lot, felt happier. 
	- Tom writes very good paper now
- client(e.g.,student, teacher) feedback/future step
