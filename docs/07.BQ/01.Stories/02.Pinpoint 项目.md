## **Situation / Task**
When I was working on  my PhD work, during my second year. , one of the goals I had was to build a code reading software, so that students can read a piece of code backwards,

- a user can record an execution of the  program (including user inputs and graphical output), replay  the output, and select a specific time interval where the event of  interest occurred, to view code that is relevant to this event.

- collaborators from my lab, junior phds, starting off by helping senor phd on a project. 


### challenges:
- we thought it's a ML project, as everyone in my lab comes from a ml background, instead of a program analysis, software engineering background. 
	- 讲作为ml问题的input，output
	- 讲我们用ml做了多少努力，但是准确率还是不高
	- however, 用ml解决不了，因为数据太少了




## **Action**

### Backend:
- backend: it needs lots of program analysis infras that I didn't have yet. 
	- In order to understand the chain of code that's responsible or related to a certain piece of code, [program slicing], we need:
		- a dynamic analysis framework, where we know which piece of code is responsible for certain output.
		- a static analysis framework, where we can find the program dependency graph and the control flow graph. 


- because we are using snap, a visual, interactive programming language, - where the primary use of this program is to build games,
	- it gets different comparing to java, where there are existing libraries that does static and dynamic analysis. 
	- so the first step is to build those program analysis infra's . 

- From lots of litterature search I found a lab in a German university doing similar things. 
	- So I reached out to them and started working on the program analysis infras together. 
	- This actually led to 4 projects that I work with them. 2 of them was led by me and 2 of them was led by them. 
		- And of course, 4 papers came out of this the first year after. 
	- And we finished building all of the static and dynamic analysis infras that's needed for the next work - which is actually making a student-centered software.

### Frontend
For the front-end, I needed to build a software where 
- play mario, replay, ..., see code. 

I did the following:
- I used two months to finish the first prototype, tested it with 3 students, they all suggested very interesting things:
	- auto-generate timestamps (e.g., this is when mario starts jumping! This is when mario his boomba)
	- auto-generate code slices (some code slices are more oftenly required than others, e.g., (same as above)). When..timestamp, meanwhile, generate code slice. 
	- lots of user experience suggestions - making it load faster, etc. 
	- no instruction experience - how to make it so that they can work through it without using instructions. 

- another month for second prototype, 8 people testing
- another 2 weeks for the final prototype, then ran a controlled study, then writing paper. 


## **Result**
- 5 papers. 
	- 3 first-authored, 
		- One best paper. 
	- 2 co-authored, one is a journal paper
	- Finished them in 2 years. 
- students said very positive things:
	- participants discussed that the slider bar “makes it  a lot easier finding certain codes”, as alternatively in  Snap!, 
		- “you may have to search through ... each sprite, to ...  find code”.
	- it basically changes the  scope, like instead of having to read through the whole code,  
you can just zoom in on the specific piece you want and look  at that.”
- “I prefer ... looking at [Pinpoint] where the code is divided up. ... I think it is easier to look at how stuff are related that way, instead of just looking at it line by line.”
