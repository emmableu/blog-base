I have missed the deadline for a whisker for for journal paper actually I have just submitted again this summer but that was supposed to be submitted the summer before hand so summer 2020 so so it was a accented pump conference paper where the the the conference will nicer sausages extended offer for us to write a journal about the work that we have done however it was a very collaborative work with everyone on their own agenda so it's very difficult order nice people backed on this journal and right before the submission we have found a big error of an important hour on the calculation of a specific metric of the data so we won't we wasn't able to submit that I went to one choice that we had was to actually submit that and and if it's accepted weekend I just the difference is if it's small however that stupid difference that never looks small back then because we wasn't able to trace back the root cause it could be actually more difficult than we have thought thought about so we have submitted the paper again now.
