## Situation / Task
- I said no to a intern subtask
	- find friends of a user, and based on the dislike history of the friends, generate synthetic data about the dislike history of user. 


## Action
- I found the dislike history of a group 500 friends, and found that among 2000 shared views among these friends, there is only 1 overlap of dislikes

- As doing this requires lots of join operations (no computational resource), and introduces  lots of bias. 

- I replaced it with a task that I proposed myself, and I brought them to my intern manager. 
	- We spent actually several meetings clarifying things,
	- and some times he did not have the time to fully understand before he jump to another meeting
	- so I even made a powerpoint presentation to explain more clearly.
	- This took a week, while at the same time I was working on my alternative idea.
	- When my manager was fully convinced, my alternative idea was working as well. 



- 我后来还发现可以把那个项目改成collaborative filtering，首先寻找likelyminded 的 user，或者寻找对于某个相同的item，有哪些人点了踩，那么和这些人比较类似的，还没有看过这个item的人，可能也会点踩。 
- 我就写了一个workplace post，把这个想法写下来了，但是我没有时间去做完这个，因为我之前做的那个要launch



## result:

**overall ROC_AUC**: 5% increase, 0.85 -> 0.90
**ROC_AUC on cold users** (users with < 1year facebookage): 8% increase, 0.80 -> 0.88
**ROC_AUC users with less frequent NUF events** (users with < 1year facebookage): 7% increase, 0.82 -> 0.89

in 7 days, decreased dislike through rate (dislike over percentage view point view, dislike includes the 9 events I've mentioned) by 4.8%

as a result increased the like through rate by 3%

## takeaway
have backbone:

- Disagrees with peers and supervisors using data to thoughtfully explain counter-arguments  
- Stands up for what he/she believes is in the best interest of the company and the customer  
- Advocates clearly and passionately for beliefs  
- Openly supports and commits to decisions that have been made, even if not originally in agreement
