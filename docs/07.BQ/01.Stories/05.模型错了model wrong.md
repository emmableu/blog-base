## Background:
- in fall 2020, developed a model that uses pq-gram mining (includes AST sub-structure), found F1 scores significantly higher than the prediction results produced by the 1-hot encodings. 
 	- in the 6 classification tasks (e.g., predicting jumping, wrap around the screen, move with key, etc)
	- F1 was in general about 20% - 30% higher - for those that were around 0.5 - it became 0.6 or 0.7

there were 2 implementations:
1. pq gram
2. differential pattern mining: find the patterns that were different from the positive training sample to the negative training sample - only use patterns that appear more either in the pos or neg samples, but not use patterns that appeared equally. This was to decrease the dimension of the input vector.



**action**

- I just thought it was wierd - the improvement did not feel real. 
- Paper almost due. Advisor encouraged me to take another look, but by looking at all of my model, code and data he thought it seems a credible results - so are my collaborators.


## challenge
- I looked all of the data manually, and I found that it was because 
	- I got the results by cross validation
	- at every round of the cross validation, I get the new "differential patterns" from the new training dataset.
	- however 训练的时候之前得到的feature没有被及时清理好，所以被接着用了，这些feature里面有testing data的信息。
