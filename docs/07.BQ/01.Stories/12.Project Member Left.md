So I'm in two thousand and nineteen on that was the first year when I joined our schools PST programs I was working on a project where I need to put on field at the Salvation Army varmint and then on a senior member of our of overlap was in charge of running a study based on my tool and then on and then he used that would right of paper about so you're telling our lack when you join love you work on our building or something or just doing something like collaborative work for someone else's project however on that specific team member of that that made have to decided to change to another lab when I was working on the project so so because she wasn't able to help me run the study I need to complete a study design and and run a study in just town in just two weeks time sorry just one months time


## Background

### 时间
3 years ago 

### 项目内容
- 项目本身的motivation: build a self-paced learning environment, as no such thing exist for snap
- 项目的大概内容: 

### 人物
- project lead: 一个senior phd
- 我的任务: 写代码
- 别的人: 只有我的advior，没有别的人

## Challenge
the senior phd decided to join another professor's lab, and no longer works on the project

还有一个月study，我还有下列challenge：
- system 没写完，lots of polishing up 

剩下的都是senior的工作，但是她没做：
- 没有做pilot study (解释什么是pilot study)
- 没有提交irb
- 没有设计study

study plan is as important as building the system

随时和collaborator / advisor 跟进进展，因为每天都有进展，我有的时候就写一下简短的邮件update


## Action
- make plans

- invite people with very nice-looking presentations / pitch
	- got a few more junior phds
	- many more senior students and professors from other lab gave me very good suggestions

- pilot study 的时候测试 study plan，因为system 已经90%，但是study plan is a solution that needs lots of help because I'm not experienced. 
	- 所以，没有把system做到100%
	- 而是把study plan 做到good enough, 然后90% 的system， **test 这个更重要，** 因为没人test过这个，

- 最后还有时间，就把system能改进的也都改进了。

- very busy, but used trello and google calendar to track time. 

## Results
- 直接结果： 项目/论文
- collaborator feedback/future step
- client(e.g.,student, teacher) feedback/future step
- 让我得到了更好的学习机会

## Takeaway
- planning and revise plan
- trello and google calendar
- constantly keeping everyone updated / interested, in case they can help.
