## Self Introduction
### general Version
I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. student at NC State University (expected graduation in Jan 2023).

In my PhD work I research  ways to generate intelligent support (e.g., code examples, hints) for kids and colleage students to learn programming. For example, when they are working on designing and building a programming artifact, for example, a pong or a mario game, can we auto-generate code examples or hints that helps them achieve their goals. 

What I'm excited about is that kids can use my tool to make things *open_ended*
- build things that they themselves feel meaningful
- that can enpower them
- make them feel confident, interested in CS, feel that they could use CS as a tool to build things that matters to them the most. 
- and I could provide support to them during the process. 


This summer I also did an internship as an Machine Learning Engineer in Meta, so I have a little bit of industry experience on how to apply ML methods in, for example, the feed ranking system that I was working on.

But in school I write papers mostly in the HCI - human computer interaction area, meaning that all of the tools or softwares I built is focused on people - so they ends up being used by programming students - usually college students in computer science classrooms, but also some middle schoolers and high schoolers. So, yeah, I'm mainly interested in building things that can be used by real people, or make those things better. Like I did in my internship. 


### ML Version
I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. student at NC State University (expected graduation in Jan 2023).

 I research  ways to generate intelligent support (e.g., code examples, hints) for kids and colleage students to learn programming. For example, when they are working on designing and building a programming artifact, for example, a pong or a mario game, can we auto-generate code examples or hints that helps them achieve their goals. 

Before that - I did a master's degree in statistics. 

I actually went to NC State first to learn statistics 

after that, I wanted to learn more about the modern, computational ML methods that are actually impacting millions or billions of real people in the world, (and of course, benefiting from using data of those real people in the world as well), so 

 so I did a PHD in CS.
 
  I chose an advisor who does ML in human-computer interaction. because
- I like ml - I love the computational aspects behind it and the fact that it's impacting millions of people in the world. 
- I like HCI - building things that can be used by real people (my passion)

Although, in the end I found that my thesis project - also the grant I'm funded on - it's a problem that can  be much more elegantly solved with a traditional, program analysis, (code analysis, static/dynamic analysis) approach, so I did not end up applying lots of ML in my PhD degree - only a little bit, in the first 2 projects/papers that I've published in my phd career. 

But I enjoyed my phd time - 



What I'm excited about is that kids can use my tool to make things *open_ended*
- build things that they themselves feel meaningful
- that can enpower them
- make them feel confident, interested in CS, feel that they could use CS as a tool to build things that matters to them the most. 
- and I could provide support to them during the process.

## Summer Intern Project

During my internship at Meta, I worked on improving our team's feed ranking model - the goal of this model, which is called PNUF (Personalized negative user feedback) is to improve users'  experience on the news feeds by reducing, or demoting contents 
- low quality content
- or content the users do not like. - i.e., contents that they have chose to hide, x-out, or report before, we will demote similar stuff when they might see them again.

So the goal of my project was pretty open-ended, I needed to find issues on the current model first, and then find ways to address them.

## Code2Vec Project Experience

my role:
- wrote the feature extraction part of the code.
- did lit review, verified the embedding clusters
