## Self Introduction

I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. student at NC State University (expected graduation in Jan 2023).

In my PhD work I research  ways to generate intelligent support (e.g., code examples, hints) for kids and colleage students to learn programming. For example, when they are working on designing and building a programming artifact, for example, a pong or a mario game, can we auto-generate code examples or hints that helps them achieve their goals. 

What I'm excited about is that kids can use my tool to make things *open_ended*
- build things that they themselves feel meaningful
- that can enpower them
- make them feel confident, interested in CS, feel that they could use CS as a tool to build things that matters to them the most. 
- and I could provide support to them during the process. 


This summer I also did an internship as an Machine Learning Engineer in Meta, so I have a little bit of industry experience on how to apply ML methods in, for example, the feed ranking system that I was working on.

But in school I write papers mostly in the HCI - human computer interaction area, meaning that all of the tools or softwares I built is focused on people - so they ends up being used by programming students - usually college students in computer science classrooms, but also some middle schoolers and high schoolers. So, yeah, I'm mainly interested in building things that can be used by real people, or make those things better. Like I did in my internship. 




## Summer Intern Project

During my internship at Meta, I worked on improving our team's feed ranking model - the goal of this model, which is called PNUF (Personalized negative user feedback) is to improve users'  experience on the news feeds by reducing, or demoting contents 
- low quality content
- or content the users do not like. - i.e., contents that they have chose to hide, x-out, or report before, we will demote similar stuff when they might see them again.

So the goal of my project was pretty open-ended, I needed to find issues on the current model first, and then find ways to address them.
