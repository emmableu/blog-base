## Self Introduction
### general Version
I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. student at NC State University (expected graduation in Jan 2023).

In my PhD work I research  ways to generate intelligent support (e.g., code examples, hints) for kids and colleage students to learn programming. For example, when they are working on designing and building a programming artifact, for example, a pong or a mario game, can we auto-generate code examples or hints that helps them achieve their goals. 

What I'm excited about is that kids can use my tool to make things *open_ended*
- build things that they themselves feel meaningful
- that can enpower them
- make them feel confident, interested in CS, feel that they could use CS as a tool to build things that matters to them the most. 
- and I could provide support to them during the process. 


This summer I also did an internship as an Machine Learning Engineer in Meta, so I have a little bit of industry experience on how to apply ML methods in, for example, the feed ranking system that I was working on.

But in school I write papers mostly in the HCI - human computer interaction area, meaning that all of the tools or softwares I built is focused on people - so they ends up being used by programming students - usually college students in computer science classrooms, but also some middle schoolers and high schoolers. So, yeah, I'm mainly interested in building things that can be used by real people, or make those things better. Like I did in my internship. 


### ML Version
I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. student at NC State University.

I do learning analytics and HCI research, so
- how to detect students' cognitive activities based on their coding problem solutions
- how to generate intelligent support (e.g., code examples, hints) for kids and colleage students to learn programming. 

- For example, when they are working on designing and building a programming artifact, for example, a pong or a mario game,
	- can we understand what they are struggling at
	- can we auto-generate code examples or hints that helps them achieve their goals. 

the first part of my phd time (first 2 years) is very ML focused, I researched ways
- extracting code features from complex project
- predicting the meaning of a sub-component of a programming code
- clustering types of misconceptions from students' programming projects. 


Afterwards I worked on traditional code analysis, parsing, compiler related work, and also pure HCI work, such as building real softwares and running human studies.

the focus of my research right now is to support kids doing *open_ended* programming
- build things that they themselves feel meaningful
- that can enpower them
- make them feel confident, interested in CS, to feel that they could use CS as a tool to build things that matters to them the most. 
- and I could provide support to them during the process. 





## Summer Intern Project

During my internship at Meta, I worked on improving our team's feed ranking model - the goal of this model, which is called PNUF (Personalized negative user feedback) is to improve users'  experience on the news feeds by reducing, or demoting contents 
- low quality content
- or content the users do not like. - i.e., contents that they have chose to hide, x-out, or report before, we will demote similar stuff when they might see them again.

So the goal of my project was pretty open-ended, I needed to find issues on the current model first, and then find ways to address them.

(overall ROC_AUC : 85%)

**overall ROC_AUC**: 5% increase, 0.85 -> 0.90
**ROC_AUC on cold users** (users with < 1year facebookage): 8% increase, 0.80 -> 0.88
**ROC_AUC users with less frequent NUF events** (users with < 1year facebookage): 7% increase, 0.82 -> 0.89

in 7 days, decreased dislike through rate (dislike over percentage view point view, dislike includes the 9 events I've mentioned) by 4.8%

as a result increased the like through rate by 3%
