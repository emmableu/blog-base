Tell me about a deep learning project you've worked on

**motivation**: 

in my area of research, learning analytics, there's also a big research space for applying ML -     
learning analytics means

understanding students, -  
including understanding students' thoughts, ideas, and misconceptions, which sometimes resembles a lot with NLP tasks - deriving meanings from texts, in our case, codes

So the project I've worked on, I got the idea from the code2vec paper published in 2019, it is about learning code embeddings and use them to predict function names

I saw this idea and I wanted to apply it in my work - in novice programming tasks.  Because:
- it is at that time the state-of-the-art work in predicting method names based on functions.
- It uses simple but interesting feature extraction - AST tree, leaf-to-leaf paths
- It uses attention mechanism to find the part of the code that's most predictive of its function name. For example, in a sorting algorithm,...
- It creates code-embeddings in the layer before the attention layer. While the paper did not dig deep into that I believe just like word embeddings, those code embeddings could be rather useful - like the misconception clustering task that I have mentioned. 

But different from code2vec, 
- we had much less data, code2vec has about 2 million pieces of code as training dataset, we have 207 from 4 semesters.
- we don't predict method names - students write script-like functions that we only has labeled as right or wrong. 


input: 207 student programs, AST leaf-to-leaf paths

output: right/wrong

F1 score: 81%, 30% higher than SVM, 12% higher than traditional NN

misconceptions

embedding -> PCA -> k-means clustering -> expert interpretations

some of the big clusters include: 
	- cannot detect by program execution - these are logic errors. 
- variable misuse - supposed to use x, but uses y
- index off by 1 error, so when you iterative through indexes, it is easy to loop one index out of the loop, or return one index before or after the target index, for example, in a binary search problem
- don't know how to write a loop - so unroll a loop by repeating code inside of the loop
