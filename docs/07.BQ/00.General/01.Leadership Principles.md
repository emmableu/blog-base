## Insist on the Highest Standards (Tibor)
*Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high.

- Emphasizes speed over quality for most projects  
- Fails to recognize the long-term impact of lower standards  
- Creates or accepts goals that are too easily achievable  
- Accepts quick solutions to problems with minimal follow-up to ensure they are addressed

## Ownership (Bar Raiser)

## Dive Deep (Qie)
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emmableu/image/master/202209172101224.png)

- Stays connected to the details of projects and programs  
- Understands how different groups or systems work together  
- Critically evaluates metrics and data  
- Asks good questions that provide clarity to situations  
- Steps in and gets work done  
- Investigates and get details in order to solve a problem  
- Gathers information to solve a problem, even if it's difficult or time-consuming  
  
NO:  
- Does not understand the details of projects  
- Does not understand how different groups or systems work together  
- Only holds surface-level understanding of metrics and data  
- Does not question assumptions  
- Unable to step in and get work done



## Invent and Simplify (Qie)

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

- Seeks out opportunities to improve a product or process  
  
NO:  
- Accepts current processes even if there is room for improvement  
- Creates a cumbersome process to solve a short-term problem  
- Allows complex processes to exist within their control  
- Doesn't share discoveries and insights with others  
- Only focuses on ideas and resources that can be gathered internally  
- Discourages others from exploring new ideas  
- Looks for a standard process or series of steps to copy  
- Speaks at length about the difficulty of doing something without naming ideas for a better process


## Think Big (Yu)
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
