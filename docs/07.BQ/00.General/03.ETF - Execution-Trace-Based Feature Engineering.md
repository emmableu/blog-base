## people & time

phd second-year 

me: project lead
my advisor: advising
3 other professors: also on the grant, help me write paper, generat ideas. 
some other masters and undergraduate students

## Motivation

- goal: formative feedback for visual interactive programs (snap)
	- perform rubric-based predictions

- prior work: syntax-based approaches
	- bag of words

## ETF Approach


my motivation for looking into other directions:
- the existing approaches don't work - less accuracy
- I found that in textbased languages there are methods to mine execution trace:
	- texada, which mines linear temporal logic (LTL) relationships of arbitrary length and complexity from textual logs.
	- Texada takes as input a log of traces and a property type expressed in LTL and outputs instantiations of this property types with log events which hold on the entire log. 
	- it also supports confidence and support thresholds to allow for mining on imperfect or incomplete logs.

I thought that I could use this idea in the system that I want to build. 

I made a detailed plan and send it to my advisor, and he approved
- I also need a dynamic analysis framework to record the execution trace
	- also need to run it quicker, because otherwise ... 
- the key detail is to figure out how to split/mine the patterns on an execution trace


- my work: execution-trace approach
	- first work
	- based on program logs extracted during run time.

accelerated running => 10 times faster than running a normal Snap program.

Causing experimenting these to be extremely quick 
- finish running and getting the data from those programs 162 * 5 take 30 minutes, if only running it once, would only need 6 minutes. 

really simple model (e.g., logistic regression), training speed is negligible

## Outcome
- paper published
- led to future work
	- people from other research (a professor from UCDavis) contacted me to ask questions about how to adapt this methods into their own project
- similar method was included in my advisor's next grant
	- where he proposed another student to follow up on this work. 



## takeaway

invent and simplify:
-   Generates new ideas or methods for solving a problem
-   Identifies areas for improvement and deliver new features that are scalable and avoid unnecessary complexity
-   Actively gathers ideas from a wide range of internal and external sources
-   Focuses on solutions that will impact the customer experience long-term
-   Seeks out opportunities to improve a product or process
