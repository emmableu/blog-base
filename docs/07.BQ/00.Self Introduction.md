## Self Introduction

I'm a 4th-year Ph.D. student at NC State University (expected graduation in Jan 2023).

I research ways to generate intelligent support (e.g., code examples, hints) for computer science students. For example, when they are working on designing and building a programming artifact, for example, a pong or a mario game, can we auto-generate code examples or hints that helps them achieve their goals. 

I use code analysis and ML methods to build end-to-end programming software for real-world students.

I write papers mostly in the HCI - human computer interaction area, meaning that all of the tools or softwares I built is focused on people - so they ends up being used by programming students - usually college students in computer science classrooms, but also some middle schoolers and high schoolers.

## Summer Intern Project

During my internship at Meta, I worked on improving our team's feed ranking model - the goal of this model, which is called PNUF (Personalized negative user feedback) is to improve users'  experience on the news feeds by reducing, or demoting contents 
- low quality content
- or content the users do not like. - i.e., contents that they have chose to hide, x-out, or report before, we will demote similar stuff when they might see them again.

So the goal of my project was pretty open-ended, I needed to find issues on the current model first, and then find ways to address them.
