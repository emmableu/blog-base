## Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

## Ownership

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job". 

## Invent and Simplify

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

## Are Right, A Lot

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgement and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

## Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.


## Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

## Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

## Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 


## Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

## Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

## Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

## Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### Team / time management (positive & negative) https://youtu.be/CQG4Ui0oAmk 

#### 1. Not meeting time commitment
*Tell me about a time when you were not able to meet a time commitment. What prevented you from meeting it? What was the outcome and what did you learn from it?*

**Situation & Task:**
- During my internship with Facebook Feed Ranking team, where I was working on improving our team's PNUF model's offline and online performance, one of the task I needed to do was to add multiple negative-labeled data from another very large dataset. 

- The technical steps to do that is pretty straight-forward - I just find users who only has positive-only labels, and do a join with the original dataset to find the negative labeled samples. Of course there are some other details to handle such as picking only the same amount of positive-labels as the existing negative labels to achieve a balanced sample, etc, but this is the main idea. 

- But the thing is both of the two datasets are very big, and doing a join takes up lots of resources.  
	- I tested it for 1 day and it took 10 hours. 
	- And to put the dataset into the model training pipeline it needs to backfill at least 7 days of data. 
	- so I needed about 3 more days to complete making the dataset. 
	- And model training and offline evaluation takes about another 12 hours. So in total 4 days. 

- It was actually still within the time that I had - my plan was to finish this in a week. But when I was backfilling the 7 days of data, the backfill pipeline stopped at the second day, saying that our team have been way over on computational resource quota, and as a result everyone has a very limited quota that's allowed per day. And I was blocked from running any pipeline for 3 days.  

**Action:** 
- So there are 3 distinct moments where I planned or adjusted the plan for the expected time:
	- first is when I started, while I did not work on the exact same task, I put a week as this is the amount of time that I took for a similar task before. 
	- Second is when I realized that backfilling data will take about 3 days. Since it's still within a week's constraint - although a little tight, I just written them down in my 1-1 meeting note with my manager - about the time needed on backfill, and about the . But since I was responsible for my own project and there's not much I need help from him at that time, I just informed him that this is what's going on, and he thought that is a reasonable amount of time as well. 
	- The third time is when I was blocked at running any pipelines. 
		- I immediately submitted a ticket and reached out to the oncall person for this, but she did not respond for about half a day. My manager suggested me to just wait, as the task that I was working on was pretty exploratory and our team do not have launch or production deadlines that depend on it. 
		- But I thought that even if I got un-blocked by the oncall person, I will run into storage issue again if nothing's changed - so I did two things.
			- First I tried to optimize my pipeline. Sadly there's not much I could do other than just a tiny little bit of pre-filtering before the join operations. Just in case there may be other ways that may do, I made a workplace post in our group and tagged a few people to check if my algorithm was efficient enough. Two of my peers mentioned some other  updates, including additional pre-filtering and switch the tables before and after the join operation, so select from the larger table and join the smaller. After the oncall un-blocked me the next day, I found that a test run for one day has been decreased to 5 hours. 
			- So the other thing that I did is that I brought this up to a senior engineer in our team to  resource quota let her know about this resource quota issue that I was experiencing. And she told me that many of our team members had pipelines that are no longer needed - that are still running - she knows about it but just did not have time to resolve this. So I just went ahead and prepared a spreadsheet by collecting all of the pipelines that were running in our team, with the stakeholders' names and the amount of times they were running. The senior engineer then used the spreadsheet to suggest people to shut down or delete pipelines that are no longer needed, and used this to track people's progress.
	
**Result**
		- In just about 2 days and a half I got the amount of resources I needed to finish my runs.  While in the end my task was still delayed for about a day over plan, I have learned a lot about how to simplify sql queries, and helped our team cleaned up lots of unneeded resource space for future operations. 
		- And I was also doing some other tasks in parallel while waiting for resources to free up, so time wasn't really wasted. 


**LP Discussion:**
- Ownership: Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job". 
- Bias for Action: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 




#### 2. Long-term project management
*Describe a long-term project that you managed. How did you keep everything moving along in a timely manner?*

**Situation / Task**
- School research project - building intelligent support for creative, open-ended programming.
	- Very open-ended project: 
		- lots of routes to take, 
		- have no idea how much time each is going to take. 
		- I am responsible of the time, the pacing, and everything. 
		- Supposed to last my entire phd time, so it's easy to make too big or unrealistic of a plan and unable to complete it. 

	- Lots of people. 
		- advisor
		- collaborators from other labs, 5
		- teachers who help us run studies: 3 per semester, one big summer camp each summer
		- masters and undergrad students

**Action**
- Planning: 
	- long-term plan, revisit every semester
	- short-term plan: take it paper by paper. Month by month. 
- People:
	- understanding their needs and goals:
		- everyone needs different things from collaborating on this project. The only way to keep them all motivated and willing to help is to keep them interested, help them get what they need from this project.
		- e.g., undergrads: goal is to learn and work on interesting programming tasks. 
		- junior PhD students: goal is to learn and collaborate on an research.
	- deliver projects that makes sense to them. 
- key factor: me. Spending time and effort working on it.

Clients https://youtu.be/OFEUzyB12rE 
I get nervous when I need to speak in front of a large group. In my second year, my Advisor asked me to do a presentation in the joint retreat of our department, and I did it quite bad., I got so nervous and could not understand the questions asked. I realized that this is a big problem for me, so I kept taking English courses provided where you need to present every class. Also, I am TAing many semesters, so the situation get much better. Now I am comfortable presenting for small team, but for large group of people. I am still not sure if I can do it confidently.

35. Why Amazon https://youtu.be/H_KGM0i9jkA
The reason that I am interested in Amazon and especially AWS is that I think people here are tool builders. At the beginning, I like Amazon because of kindle. I like reading hardcopy books when I was a undergraduate, but the books are causing trouble when I need to move, and then I found e-readers back in China. But those ones have all kinds of shortcomings, such as the high latency.  
Later I bought kindle and everything goes so smoothly. When I was working on my side projects, I used AWS EC2 and S3, and although I had quite few users, but I know I don’t need to worry even I got many users, because AWS will take care of the scalability for me. Also, I am a new graduate, I want to work hard and learn all kinds of things, and based on my reading, people are saying you can gain more skills in Amazon compared to other companies.
