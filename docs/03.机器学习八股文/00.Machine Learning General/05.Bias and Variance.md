#### bias
Bias are the simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn.

Generally, linear algorithms have a high bias (因为有很多个假设) making them fast to learn and easier to understand but generally less flexible. In turn, they have lower predictive performance on complex problems that fail to meet the simplifying assumptions of the algorithms bias.

-   **Low Bias**: Suggests less assumptions about the form of the target function.
-   **High-Bias**: Suggests more assumptions about the form of the target function.

Examples of **low-bias** machine learning algorithms include: Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines.

Examples of **high-bias** machine learning algorithms include: Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression.

简单的说法：
- bias仅针对training set，描述的是根据training set拟合出的模型的输出预测结果的期望与training set本身的差距，简单讲，就是在样本上拟合的好不好。要想在bias上表现好，low bias，就得复杂化模型，增加模型的参数，但这样容易过拟合 (overfitting)，过拟合对应上图是high variance，点很分散。low bias对应就是点都打在靶心附近，所以瞄的是准的，但手不一定稳。

#### Variance

Variance is the amount that the estimate of the target function will change if different training data was used.

The target function is estimated from the training data by a machine learning algorithm, so we should expect the algorithm to have some variance. Ideally, it should not change too much from one training dataset to the next, meaning that the algorithm is good at picking out the hidden underlying mapping between the inputs and the output variables.


Machine learning algorithms that have a high variance are strongly influenced by the specifics of the training data. This means that the specifics of the training have influences the number and types of parameters used to characterize the mapping function.

-   **Low Variance**: Suggests small changes to the estimate of the target function with changes to the training dataset.
-   **High Variance**: Suggests large changes to the estimate of the target function with changes to the training dataset.

Generally, nonlinear machine learning algorithms that have a lot of flexibility have a high variance. For example, decision trees have a high variance, that is even higher if the trees are not pruned before use.

Examples of **low-variance** machine learning algorithms include: *Linear Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Logistic Regression*.

Examples of **high-variance** machine learning algorithms include: *Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machines*.


简化的说法：
- variance描述的是training set上训练出来的模型在test set上的表现，要想在variance上表现好，low variance，就要简化模型，减少模型的参数，但这样容易欠拟合(under-fitting)，欠拟合对应上图是high bias，点偏离中心。low variance对应就是点都打的很集中，但不一定是靶心附近，手很稳，但是瞄的不准。

generalization error: 模型在新样本集（测试集）上的误差称为“泛化误差”（generalization error）。  

generalization error = bias^2 + variance + noise.
