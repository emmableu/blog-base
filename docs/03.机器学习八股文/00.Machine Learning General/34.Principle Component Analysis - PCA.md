## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

Assume, we have two interest bearing accounts. The first gives an interest rate of 5%, the second a 3% interest, with annual compound.

Assume that after $t$ years the amounts in the two accounts are represented by a 2-vector:

$$x^{(t)} = \begin{bmatrix}
 amount in Account 1 \\[0.3em]
 amount in Account 2
\end{bmatrix}$$

The growth of the amounts in one year can be described in a matrix:

$$x^{(t+1)} = \begin{bmatrix}
 a_{11} & a_{12} \\[0.3em]
 a_{21} & a_{22}
\end{bmatrix} x^{(t)}$$

Given the specification of the interest rate above, this simple case gives us:

$$x^{(t+1)} = \begin{bmatrix}
 1.05 & 0    \\[0.3em]
 0    & 1.03
\end{bmatrix} x^{(t)}$$

Let $A$ denote the matrix: 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
 1.05 & 0    \\[0.3em]
 0    & 1.03
\end{bmatrix}$$

$A$ is a diagonal. If we initially put \$ 100 on each account, we can compute the result of the accummulated interest after a year as:

```python
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[100],
              [100]])
A = np.array([[1.05, 0],
              [0,    1.03]])
A.dot(x)
```


After two years the accounts would be:

```python
A.dot(A.dot(x))
```

If we might want to know how $x^{(100)}$ compares to $x^{(0)}$, we could iterate over:

$$\begin{align}
x^{(100)} & = A x^{(99)} \\
          & = A(Ax^{(98)}) \\
          & = A(A(Ax^{(97)})) \\
          & \vdots \\
          & = \underbrace{A \cdot A \dots A}_\text{100 times} \ x^{(0)} 
\end{align}$$
