## Description
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 
## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```
 
## Solution
[滑动窗口模版](https://emmableu.github.io/blog/pages/27241c/)  
以example1, `s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"`为例,需要以下变量：
- `need = Counter(t)`: `{"A":1, "B": 1, "C": 1}`
- `window = defaultdict(int)`: 一个dict, 更新当前窗口内，且`need`包括的char的个数
    - 比如，当遍历到s中第四位`E`时， `window = {A:1, B:1}` (不用包括E)
-  `valid`: 当前window内，满足`need`要求的char的个数
    - 比如，当遍历到s中第四位`E`时， `valid = 2`
- `min_size_start_tpl`：一个tuple，记录当前Minimum Window Substring的size和起始位置
```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s, t):
        l, r = 0, 0
        need = Counter(t)
        window = defaultdict(int)
        valid = 0
        min_size_start_tpl = (float("inf"), 0)
        while r < len(s):
            c = s[r]
            r += 1
            if c in need: 
                window[c] += 1
                valid += int(window[c] == need[c])

            while valid == len(need):
                min_size_start_tpl = min(
                  min_size_start_tpl, (r - l, l)
                )
                d = s[l]
                l += 1
                if d in need:
                    valid -= int(window[d] == need[d])
                    window[d] -= 1
        size, start = min_size_start_tpl
        if size == float("inf"):
            return ""
        else:
            return s[start:start + size]
```
