`[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- prefix_product:` [1, 1, 2, 6] `  ----> this is the product of the left of the element
    `p[i] = p[i-1]*nums[i-1]`
- suffix_product:`[24, 12, 4, 1]` ----> this is the product of the right of the element
    `s[i] = s[i+1]*nums[i+1]`

- the above is essentially O(n) space complexity.
- To change that to O(1) space complexity: change results based on prefix_product

suffix_product (now is a number) = 1, 4, 12, ...


```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        res = [1]
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            res.append(res[-1]*nums[i])
        suffix_product = 1
        for i in range(len(res)-2, -1, -1):
            suffix_product = nums[i+1] * suffix_product
            res[i] = res[i]*suffix_product
        return res
```
