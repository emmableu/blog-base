## Description
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.

## Example
```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```
Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
## Solution: 递归
- 注意：
1. `inner_max`: 作为子树，每次要计算包括当前节点在内的最大和，这个最大和只能选择左边或右边,这个innermax可以在每个dfs中直接返回
2. `global_max`: 计算`global_max`时，子树的左边和右边则都要考虑
```python
class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root):
        global_max = -float('inf')
        def dfs(node):
            nonlocal global_max
            if not node:
                return 0
            left = max(dfs(node.left), 0)
            right = max(dfs(node.right), 0)
            inner_max = node.val + max(left, right)
            global_max = max(global_max, node.val + left + right)
            return inner_max
        dfs(root)
        return global_max    
```
