## Description
Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:

- The path starts with a single slash '/'.
- Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
- The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
- The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')
Return the simplified canonical path.

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

Example 2:
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.

Example 3:
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.

Example 4:
Input: path = "/a/./b/../../c/"
Output: "/c"
```
## Solution
需要的变量 (以example 4, Input: path = "/a/./b/../../c/", Output: "/c" 为例)：
- `stk`: 一个list，最后为 ["c"], 一个一个放进去，遇到 `.`就跳过，遇到`..`就pop最后一个。
```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        stk = []
        path = path.split("/")

        for item in path:
            if item == "..":
                if stk : stk.pop()
            elif item and item != ".":
                stk.append(item)
        return "/" + "/".join(stk)
```

## 脸家面试变种: 给 pwd 和 cd，返回 full path
其中destination可以是绝对也可以是相对路径。   
assume pwd 和 cd 给的都不是规范的
```python
def full_path(pwd_path, cd_path):
    stk = []
    if not cd_path.startswith("/"):  # 说明是相对路径
        simplify_path(pwd_path, stk)
    simplify_path(cd_path, stk)
    return "/" + "/".join(stk)


def simplify_path(path, stk) -> str:
    path = path.split("/")

    for item in path:
        if item == "..":
            if stk: stk.pop()
        elif item and item != ".":
            stk.append(item)


assert full_path("/home/a", "/users/x") == "/users/x"  # 绝对路径
assert full_path("/home/a", "x/./y/../../z/") == "/home/a/z"  # 相对路径
assert full_path("/home/../home/./a", "../b") == "/home/b"  # 相对路径
assert full_path("/home/a", "./b") == "/home/a/b"  # 相对路径
```
