## Description:
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 
## Examples
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Solution
start off by initializing a list with all 0s.
```python
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)
        res = [0]*n
        l, r, marker = 0, n-1, n-1
        while l <= r:
            if abs(nums[l]) > abs(nums[r]):
                res[marker] = nums[l]*nums[l]
                l += 1
            else:
                res[marker] = nums[r]*nums[r]
                r -= 1
            marker -= 1
        return res
```
