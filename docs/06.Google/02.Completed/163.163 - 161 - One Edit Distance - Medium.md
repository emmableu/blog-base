## Description
Given two strings s and t, return true if they are both one edit distance apart, otherwise return false.

A string s is said to be one distance apart from a string t if you can:

Insert exactly one character into s to get t.
Delete exactly one character from s to get t.
Replace exactly one character of s with a different character to get t.
 

## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: s = "ab", t = "acb"
Output: true
Explanation: We can insert 'c' into s to get t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = ""
Output: false
Explanation: We cannot get t from s by only one step.

Example 3:
Input: s = "a", t = ""
Output: true

Example 4:
Input: s = "", t = "A"
Output: true
```

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isOneEditDistance(self, s, t):
        if len(s) > len(t):
            return self.isOneEditDistance(t, s)
        if len(t) - len(s) > 1 or s == t:
            return False
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] != t[i]:
                return s[i+1:] == t[i+1:] or s[i:] == t[i+1:]
        return True
```
