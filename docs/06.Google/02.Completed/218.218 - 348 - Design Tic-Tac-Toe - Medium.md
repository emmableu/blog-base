Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an `n x n` board between two players:

- A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
- Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
- A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

Implement the `TicTacToe` class:

- `TicTacToe(int n)` Initializes the object the size of the board n.
- `int move(int row, int col, int player)` Indicates that the player with id `player` plays at the cell `(row, col)` of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move.

## Example
```
Input
["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
[[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
Output
[null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 100
- player is 1 or 2.
- 0 <= row, col < n
- (row, col) are unique for each different call to move.
- At most n^2 calls will be made to move.

## Solution
只保存行/列/对角线的和，而不用保存所有元素，减少空间复杂度。

- 对于player1: move() 时对对应row的sum +1, 对应col的sum+1，如果在对角线上，对角线sum + 1
- 对于player2: move() 时把 +1 全部变成-1

对于是否成功
- 对于player 1 只需判断四个值是否有一个 = n: 当前行sum，当前列sum，两个对角线。
- 对于player 2 只需判断以上四个值是否有一个 = -n:

时间复杂度为O(1)
```python
class TicTacToe(object):

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.row, self.col = [0] * n, [0] * n
        self.diag, self.anti_diag = 0, 0
        self.n = n
        
    def move(self, row, col, player):
        cur = 1 if player == 1 else -1
        self.row[row] += cur
        self.col[col] += cur
        if row == col:
            self.diag += cur
        if row + col == self.n - 1:
            self.anti_diag += cur
        if cur * self.n in [self.row[row], self.col[col], self.diag, self.anti_diag]:
            return 1 if cur == 1 else 2
        return 0
```
