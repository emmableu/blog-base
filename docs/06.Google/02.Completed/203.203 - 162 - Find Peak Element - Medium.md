## Description
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums):
        if not nums:
            return -1

        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l + 1 < r:
            mid = (l + r) >> 1
            if nums[mid] < nums[mid - 1]:
                r = mid
            elif nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
                l = mid
            else:
                return mid
        # when peak is at index 0, l is the peak index, 
        # when peak is at index len(nums)-1, r is the peak index
        mid = l if nums[l] > nums[r] else r
        return mid
```
