Here we are given birth & death year of persons.  
Imagine this as a line , when a person born , population of that year +1 and when he expires population decreases by 1.

Plot the population year on a number line.  
When a person is born increment by +1 and when he expire decrement by -1 .  
Scan from left and accumulate the population, everytime check if current population is greater than global max , if yes update population count and year both.  
This scanning from left to right is line sweep.

## Solution (O(n))
```python
class Solution:
	def maximumPopulation(self, logs):
		population = [0] * 2051
		for log in logs:
			population[log[0]] += 1
			population[log[1]] -= 1
		# 以上是得到每年的delta
		max_pop = [0, 0]
		for i in range(1950, 2051):
			population[i] += population[i - 1]
			if population[i] > max_pop[0]:
				max_pop = [population[i], i]
		return max_pop[1]
```
