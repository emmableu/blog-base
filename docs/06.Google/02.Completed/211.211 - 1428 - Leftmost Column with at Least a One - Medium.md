## Description:
A row-sorted binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1 and each row of the matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return the index (0-indexed) of the leftmost column with a 1 in it. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

You can't access the Binary Matrix directly. You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix interface:

- `BinaryMatrix.get(row, col)` returns the element of the matrix at index (row, col) (0-indexed).
- `BinaryMatrix.dimensions()` returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements [rows, cols], which means the matrix is rows x cols.
Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix mat. You will not have access to the binary matrix directly.


## Examples
```
Input: mat = [[0,0],[1,1]]
Output: 0

Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,1]]
Output: 1

Input: mat = [[0,0],[0,0]]
Output: -1
```
## Constraints:
- rows == mat.length
- cols == mat[i].length
- 1 <= rows, cols <= 100
- mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
- mat[i] is sorted in non-decreasing order.



## Method 1: (most efficient) top-right => down-left (O(m+n))
从右下角开始，遇到1往左走，遇到0往上走，走到第一行  
左右方向：负责比大小  
上下方向：负责遍历  

```python
class Solution:
    def leftMostColumnWithOne(self, binaryMatrix):
        [m, n] = binaryMatrix.dimensions()
        r, c = m-1, n-1
        while r >= 0 and c >= 0:
            if binaryMatrix.get(r, c) == 1:
                c -= 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return -1 if c==n-1 else c+1
```




## Method 2: (not efficient enough solution:) Binary search (O(m*lgn))
    - binary search
    - update right threshold for each row

### Implementation (based on this not-so-efficient method:)
```python
class Solution:
    def leftMostColumnWithOne(self, binaryMatrix):
        [m, n] =  binaryMatrix.dimensions() #remember to not use len() here.
        res = -1
        for i in range(m):
            l = -1
            if i == 0:
                r = n
            else:
                r = res  #first time: used r = res+1, this caused [[0,0], [0, 0]] here has r = 3, exceeding bounds.
            while l + 1 < r:
                mid = (l + r)//2
                if binaryMatrix.get(i, mid) == 1:
                    r = mid
                else:
                    l = mid
            res = l + 1
        # first time: only returns res. This caused inputs like [[0, 0], [0, 0]] to return 2
        return -1 if res == n else res
```
