## Description
A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent substrings with their lengths. For example, a string such as "substitution" could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):

- "s10n" ("s ubstitutio n")
- "sub4u4" ("sub stit u tion")
- "12" ("substitution")
- "su3i1u2on" ("su bst i t u ti on")
- "substitution" (no substrings replaced)
- "s010n" (leading zeros in numbers are allowed)
Note that "s55n" ("s ubsti tutio n") is not a valid abbreviation of "substitution" because the replaced substrings are adjacent.

Given a string word and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string matches with the given abbreviation.
## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: word = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n"
Output: true
Explanation: The word "internationalization" can be abbreviated as "i12iz4n" ("i nternational iz atio n").

Example 2:
Input: word = "apple", abbr = "a2e"
Output: false
Explanation: The word "apple" cannot be abbreviated as "a2e".
```

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def validWordAbbreviation(self, word, abbr):
        i, j = 0, 0 # i for abbr, j for word
        while i < len(abbr) and j < len(word):
            c, d = abbr[i], word[j]
            i += 1
            j += 1
            if c.isalpha():
                if d != c:
                    return False
            elif c == "0":
                return False
            else: # c is 1-9 here
                while i < len(abbr) and abbr[i].isdigit():
                    c += abbr[i]
                    i += 1
                j += int(c) - 1  #因为前面已经加过1了，
                # 所以这里j += int(c) - 1 
        return i == len(abbr) and j == len(word)
```
