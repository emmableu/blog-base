## Description:
You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.


## Examples
```
Example 1:
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.


Example 2:
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

参考（https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-islands/solution/dao-yu-lei-wen-ti-de-tong-yong-jie-fa-dfs-bian-li-/）
```python
class Solution:
    def func(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # 题目要求的function
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == "1":
                    # 题目要求的东西
                    self.dfs(grid, r, c)
        return #题目要求的function
        
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        # base case：如果坐标超出网格，直接返回
        if not self.in_area(grid, r, c):
            return
        if grid[r][c] != "1":
            return 
        grid[r][c] = "2" #标记以防止重复visit
        self.dfs(grid, r-1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r+1, c)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c-1)
        self.dfs(grid, r, c+1)
        
    def in_area(self, grid, r, c):
        return r >= 0 and r < len(grid) and c >= 0 and c < len(grid[0])
```

## Solution: DFS
重点：在 dfs中 `return 1 + lt + rt + up + lo` 来计算面积
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        for r in range(len(grid)):
            for c in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    max_area = max(max_area, self.dfs(grid, r, c))
        return max_area
        
        
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        if not self.in_area(grid, r, c):
            return 0
        if grid[r][c] != 1:
            return 0
        grid[r][c] = 2
        lt = self.dfs(grid, r-1, c)
        rt = self.dfs(grid, r+1, c)
        up = self.dfs(grid, r, c-1)
        lo = self.dfs(grid, r, c+1)
        return 1 + lt + rt + up + lo


    def in_area(self, grid, r, c):
        return r >= 0 and r < len(grid) and c >= 0 and c < len(grid[0])
```
