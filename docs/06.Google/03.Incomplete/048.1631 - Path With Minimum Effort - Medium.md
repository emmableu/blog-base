## Solution: Dijkstra + Binary Search

shortest path problem: 本题实际就是找从出发点(0, 0)到终点(m - 1, n - 1) 路程最短的path

这里, total path cost = maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the path. 

```python
class Solution:
	def minimumEffortPath(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> int:
		m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])
		dist = [[float('inf') for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
		dist[0][0] = 0
		min_heap = [(0, 0, 0)] # distance, row, col
		dirs = [0, 1, 0, -1, 0]

		while min_heap:
			d, r, c = heappop(min_heap)
			if d > dist[r][c]:
				continue # this is an outdated version -> skip it
			if r == m - 1 and c == n - 1:
				return d
```
