## Solution: Dijkstra + Binary Search

shortest path problem: 本题实际就是找从出发点(0, 0)到终点(m - 1, n - 1) 路程最短的path

这里, total path cost = maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the path. 

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
	def minimumEffortPath(self, heights: List[List[int]]) -> int:
		m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])
		dist = [[float('inf') for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
		q = [(0, 0, 0)] # dist, row, col
		vis = {(0, 0)}
		while q:
			ele = heapq.heappop(q):
			for
```
